
(X) 1: remind me
   	to fix the + and - signs
   	so that the fields only allow it for exponentials
   	-90.4  <-invalid
   	90e-4  <-valid

    2: user regular expression for parsing files

(X) 3: fix total percentage (adding over 100%)

    4: add this -> read from input file

(X) 5: make it so that the ExcelFiles/CHEMKED/screenshots folders 
	get copied to the dist folder on build

(X) 6: check clear table

    7: consider an FAQ section for the manual

(X) 8: program should NOT run without any intial input***

    9: look into cleaning dist folders (study more Ant)

(X) 10: FINISH WORKING ON MFR PERCENTAGE CALCULATIONS

    11: fix "Model Run Output" button not opening correctly

    12: ***VERY IMPORANT*** make sure all file dependencies are 
	 taken care of (example: if temp-SOLTMP.txt is erased from 
         CHEMKED folder, will the program run?)

---------------------- luis ----------------------------------------
(X) 1: add textfield (ambient temperature) for use in heat loss
       equation
    
    2: add heat loss equations for doEnergyBalance 1-3

    3: add heat loss due to evaporation for doEnergyBalance3

-----(from meeting)---------------------------------------------------

    7: look up how to make self-install and all that...

(X) 8: adjusting fields/not letting focus switch when value over 1.0
	(make less restrctive)

(X) 9: make Enter key be able to move to next field (with tab as well)

(X) 10: **adjust defualt dimensions (diameter for example)
	-make sure all defualt values are correct

(X) 11: take out "update all fields" button

(X) 12: in output composition, show the preferred species  
        in percentage, the rest in ppm
		-add nitrogen(percentage)

(X) 13: split the outputs (not just 1 ModelOuput.xls) so that the user
        can have Excel open while running again

(X) 14: let user look at output when running

    15: be able to store the inputs for a specific output

    16: add file management****** <-important

(X) 17: make pollutant ouputs in ppm have 1 decimal digit

(X) 18: add the other graph models (jtabbed pane with different graphs)

    19: add temperatures to output table

(X) 20: "TO Outlet Concentration"
